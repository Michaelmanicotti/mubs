#The Mutually Unbiased Bases Library
The purpose of this library is to implement various methods for constructing mutually unbiased bases as well as exporing their applications. This library serves as a sumplement to my masters thesis on the topic.

## Install Instructions
This library requires the current version of NumPy (v2.3), QuTip (v5) and was made in Python (v3.13). QuTip is a custom python library designed for quantum simulations. It can be though of as a wrapper arounf NumPy that adds some nice additional functionality useful for quantum applications. Click for more information about QuTip or NumPy.
